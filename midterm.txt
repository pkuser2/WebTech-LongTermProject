The Website- is a collection of web resources.
- The founder of HTML and W3C, Tim Berners Lee, also found the website.
- It was established in 1989.

HTML - The structure and content of a website.

CSS 
- It is the presentational output of a page.
- It is language level used to specify the presentation aspects of structurally worked up documents.
- It is developed by Hakon Wium Lee (LHSS) & Bert Bos (JOP)

Versions of CSS:
CSS 1
CSS 2.1 - June 7, 2011
CSS 3
JS - Involves the behavioral aspect of the website.

Versions of HTML:
HTML 1.0
HTML 2.0 - 1995
HTML 3.0
HTML 3.2
HTML 4.0
HTML 4.01 - December 24, 1999
 -Strict
 -Transitional
 -Frameset
HTML 5.0 - 2014
HTML 5.01 - 2016

From HTML 3.0 to 4.01 it was W3c Reccomendation 
There was a 15 year hiatus from HTML 4.0 to 5.0.
HTML 5.1 is the current HTML version being used.

XHTML - Extensible Hypertext Markup Language
- It is a reformulation in XML.
- It is data interchanged format.
XML - It is used to mark-up data.
- Standard, Well defined, Text based.

In XHTML -documents must be well-formed.
- end tags are required.
- attribute values must be quoted.
- attribute minimization.

2005-2006 Mobile technology is starting. 
-Ian Hickson helped in contributing for mobile technology to advance.

WHATWG - slowly became popular by 2012.

Why should we have DOCTYPE
- It triggers the "standards" mode rendering while the other would be in "quirks" mode.
- meaning it is compliant with HTML.
If you do not prefer DOCTYPE, it will switch to "quirks" mode. If it has DOCTYPE, It would render in "standards" mode.

They are embodied in elements. 
ex. <head>, <body>, <title>, <meta>, etc.
-Each of them follows a certain syntax.
example:
<a href = "___" > (Link) </a> - This will all lead to a document tree structure element.
<a href = "___" > - start tag
a- tagname
href- attribute name
"__"- attribute value
(Link) - content
</a> - end tag
Note: Empty elements do not have an end tag.
<img src "__" alt = "__">

CSS Preprocessor, CSS Frameworks
- Sass, Less, 960 Grid System, Bootstrap, Foundation, Materialize
SASS(Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) - The most popular preprocessors and is implemented in Ruby.
-You can also define variables.

LESS- A Preprocessor implemented in Javascript

HTML/XHTML Stylesheets
-Author styles- what author created.
-User styles- preference, seperate stylesheet.
-User Agent styles- user viewing the file.
-External stylesheets(recommended)- CSS link to HTML.
-Emebedded styles- style element
-Inline styles- style attribute

CSS Statements
@charset- character encoding scheme for mapping
@import- import other documents
@namespace- targets other documents
@document- stylesheet only applies to documents in specific page
@font-face- web donloadable files
@key frames- CSS animation
@media- responsive design

CSS Selectors
-specify which element you want to edit 
     *Selector - used as a condition in a CSS rule
     *Selector Syntax - chain of one or more sequences of simple selectors
                      - always start with type selector  and universal selector
-SIMPLE SELECTOR
    - type 
    - universal
    - attribute 
            - [attribute=value] ->> Selects all elements with target="_blank"
            - [attribute~=value] ->> Selects all elements with a title attribute containing the value you put inside the attribute
            - [attribute !=value] ->> Select elements that either don't have the specified attribute
CLASS 
    - targets the class attribute
    
    *PSEUDO CLASSES is used to define a special state of an element
         dynamic pseudo class 
         user action pseudo class - hover
                                  - active
                                  - focus
                                  
         target pseudo class -
         language pseudo class -
         ul element statement pseudo
         structural pseudo clauses
         
    
    
CSS Rule Precedence- From highest to lowest priority
-By origin and importance
	-user agent important declarations
	-user importance declorations
	-author important declarations
	-author normal declarations
	-user normal declorations
	-user agent normal declarations
-By specificity- The higer the priority
	-Inline style
	-Number of ID selectors
	-Number of class selectors, attribute selectors, pseudo-class
	-Number of type selectors & pseudo-elements
-By order - If it comes later, it goes first.

DOM
 - Implementation of DOM is not like Javascript
 - Purpose of interacting the page

JS
 - more flexible
 - Javascript has been standardized in ECMAscript language.
 
   Imperative Programming Language
            - create instruction
            - you can also sequence the instruction
   Dynamical Type
            - 
            
            How to create variable?
             You can use:
                            var - you can put it inside the function or outside
                                e.g 
                                   function f(){
                                        var x = 200;
                                        if(true){
                                        var x = 300;
                                        console.log(x);
                                        }
                                        console.log(x)
                                        }
                                       
                            let - 
 
                                e.g
                                    function f(){
                                     let x = 200l
                                     if(true){
                                      let x = 300;
                                      console.log(x);
                                     } 
                                     console.log(x)
                                     }
